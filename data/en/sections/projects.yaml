  summary: Understanding the population composition and distribution of a region affected by a major natural disaster is vital for the allocation of resources to communities in need and critical to inform mortality estimates. Currently, the US Census Bureau is the only institution that publishes reliable population estimates for the United States and its territories. Since these are published once per year, it is impossible to use census-based population estimates to assess short-term postdisaster out-of-jurisdiction migration and within-jurisdiction migration. The utilization of social media traces, coupled with mobile phone data, could provide live estimates of postdisaster population changes in disaster-affected areas.

  summary: Monitoring health systems during and after natural disasters, epidemics, or outbreaks is critical for guiding policy decisions and interventions. In the case of natural disasters the effects on public health can be direct or indirect. In the case of outbreaks and epidemics, lack of comprehensive testing or reporting can lead to challenges in measuring direct effects, while indirect effects can arise due to, for example, increased stress levels or reduced access to health services. When the effects are long lasting and difficult to detect in the short term, the accumulated effects can actually be devastating. Here we describe a statistical methodology and software that facilitates data-driven approaches.

  summary: Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. As recently as May of this year (2018), the official death count was 64. After a study describing a household survey reported a much higher death count estimate, as well as evidence of population displacement, extensive loss of services, and a prolonged death rate the government released death registry data. These newly released data will permit a better understanding of the effects of this hurricane. Here we fit a statistical model to mortality data that accounts for seasonal and non-hurricane related yearly effects. We then estimated the deviation from the expected death rate as a function of time.
