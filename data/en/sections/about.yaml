# a summary about you
summary: I am a biostatistician at [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc](https://www.regeneron.com) working in the Biostatistical Engineering team, where I leverage advanced statistical methodologies to drive impactful decision-making in pharmaceutical development. Specifically, I help develop novel digital endpoints for clinical trials through the assessment of wearable devices. I also spend my time working in Hematology Oncology clinical trials, where I oversee the design, analysis, and execution of clinical studies. 
         I have a PhD in Biostatistics from  [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), where I worked with [Rafael Irizarry](https://rafalab.github.io). My research focused on estimating human mortality and mobility after natural hazards. I received a Master's in Biostatistics in 2020 from [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) and a Bachelor's in Computational Mathematics in 2017 from the [University of Puerto Rico at Humacao](https://www.upr.edu/humacao/),  More broadly, I am interested in developing statistical methods and computational tools to elucidate problems in medicine, public health and society in general. Other interests of mine are to the right.
