# a summary about you
summary: I am a PhD candidate at [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) working with [Rafael Irizarry](https://rafalab.github.io). Currently, my research focuses on estimating human mortality and mobility after natural hazards. 
         I received my Bachelor's in Computational Mathematics in 2017 from the [University of Puerto Rico at Humacao](https://www.upr.edu/humacao/), and my Master's in Biostatistics in 2020 from [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/).
         More broadly, I am interested in developing statistical methods and computational tools to elucidate problems in medicine, public health and society in general. Other interests of mine are to the right.
